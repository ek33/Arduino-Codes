# Arduino-Codes
This repository includes the codes which are written for Arduino boards.
##BiCycle (NodeMCU)
"BiCycle" is an IOT project about recycling and I, with my team, got the first place in "K-Hackaton" with it. However, this is just the Arduino part of the project. The main objectives of this code is getting commands from the server and posting necessary informations to the server.
##usbDongle
USB Dongles with this code can be used to trick computers because computers identify them as keyboards and they send key-press commands in miliseconds. And this code sends the necessary keystrokes for changing the computers wallpaper.
